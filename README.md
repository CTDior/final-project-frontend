Project Description:
Ice Ice Breaker facilitates a less awkward team icebreaker/introduction experience. Our application allows users to express their personalities by answering a get-to-know-you profile form that was created by the group administrator. Those answers then get put into mini profiles that are then visible to other group members allowing each user to see how other's answered compared to them. This creates a fun way to easily break the ice and spark a low-stress conversation when in a virtual team environment.
